# SPA - Société Protectrice des Animaux

## Description
SPA - Société Protectrice des Animaux is a webpage on which you can handle all animal entries in the animal shelter. You can add or delete an animal, or update its information if you like.

The aim was to put into practice my React knowledge. In a near future, I will add a backend.

## Set-up
Install the node modules.
```bash
npm i
```

Then start the project with 
```bash
npm start
```

## Technos
HTML, CSS, React.
